# vscode-to-github-to-cicd-document
# In this document we are seeing how the vscode files created for code build . Mean first we will create vscode file for lambda_function.py, add dependencies in requirements file and we will add and push to github and we will Create Pull Request(PR) and we will merge from test to main branch next we will create aws lamnbdafunction and also we will create s3 bucket and next will create codebuild next again we will add buildspec file in vscode then commit it again to github and wwe can see codebuild is automatically running everything i.e what we written in lambda function and we can test and see output on aws lamabdafunction and on cloudwatch 
# we can create lambdafunction and s3 bucket before starting of codebuild
